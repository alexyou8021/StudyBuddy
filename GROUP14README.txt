Grading Level:
Same for all members

Differences:
The study map is implemented and should work as intended for event creation.
Blacklist is implemented as well as the autologin feature. The UI has changed
and includes a much cleaner and well fitted color scheme and interface. Minor
bugs were fixed from the beta version.

Instructions:
Run "pod install"
Use Cocoa Pods 1.3.1
